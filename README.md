First off mr gardner, the git --init prac1 code was a mistake, there was 
not meant to be a '--' apparently. But i've just been told by good friend 
JackPussyWillow2 that it has been amended. well done :) So far this has 
been a more engaging checkpoint practical than those lousy cp1 and app 
development topics, cudos for that.
